This directory contains all the source files of the project, that are:
- The main code file.
- A folder with all the source c++ code files.
- A folder with all the header files.

This directory has the tasks assigned to Pedro Leit√£o (ist190764) implemented.

The project solution (in the directory /code/release) already as all the files from this directory (/code/source) as an existing item.
Because of that, we don't need to do anything to recreate the release directory from the source provided.

This application is abble to:
- Check the elements present in the Scene Graph.
- Check the Blinn-Phong lighting / shading model.
- We move the camera when moving our mouse, and have a P key to change the projection.

Some issues when running this application:
- The pieces from the board (cylinder) are not drawn very well by the machine.
- Sometimes when running the application, an exception is thrown in a glUniformMatrix4fv call from the Renderer.cpp file.
