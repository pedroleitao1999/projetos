As of now, this model is using the textures from the mysackboy.littlebigplanet.com model, uploaded by Friedslick6.
The reason for this is because the default sackboy texture in the game was a 512x512 DDS seamless burlap texture that wouldn't look correct with the UVs of this model.
I have included this texture, however applying it to the model will not look correct.
Presumably LittleBigPlanet seamlessly loops this texture all around sackboy.
You can kind of make it look correct by scaling up the UVs, but there's no stitching, so it won't look great.
All of the extra textures work with the model, just switch it out.
Look for the seamless sackboy textures on the textures-resource, if you want them.
