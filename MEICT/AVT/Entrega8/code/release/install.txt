To have the application running, we need to:
1) Open a project or solution in Visual Studio 2019.
2) Select the Assignment1.sln, that is in the directory /code/release.
3) Select "Debug" as the Solution Configurations and "x64" as the Solution Platforms.
4) Run by clicking in "Local Windows Debugger".

This directory contains:
- The Visual Studio Solution file, called "Assignment1.sln".
- The Assignment1 folder, that contains the glew and glfw dependencies and all the other necessary files to run the project.
- The x64 folder, containing the debug files.
- The Assignment1 folder also contains the ".obj" files necessary to generate the board and the pieces of the scene.
