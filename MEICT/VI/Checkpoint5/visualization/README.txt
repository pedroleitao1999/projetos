In the folder where the README and the index.html files are (the folder called "visualization") open a Shell terminal and run a specific command depending on the python version:

For python: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
For python3: python -m http.server 8888

And then open on a browser (we used Google Chrome) and access the link:
http://localhost:8888/index.html
